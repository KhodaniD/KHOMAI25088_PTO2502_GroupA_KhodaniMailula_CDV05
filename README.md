# Khodani Mailula: Full Stack Developer Portfolio üöÄ

---

## Project Title

**Simple Developer Portfolio Website**

---

## Project Description

This portfolio serves as a **comprehensive showcase** of my capabilities as a Front-End Developer with a strong **Quality Assurance** foundation. It specializes in building responsive, efficient, and user-centric web applications, highlighting core skills in **Vanilla JavaScript** and a strict quality-first approach.

The site itself is a demonstration of **modern web standards** and **accessibility**. It features a high-contrast, adaptive interface with a built-in **Light/Dark Mode toggle** that respects system preferences. The architecture emphasizes **clean code**, **modular CSS (using variables)**, and a **mobile-first responsive design**, demonstrating my ability to transition technical concepts into deployable, high-quality products.

## üõ† Technologies Used (Portfolio Core)

The portfolio's foundation is built on speed, accessibility, and pure front-end mastery.

* **Front-End Core:** **HTML5** (Semantic Markup), **CSS3**, and **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**.
* **Styling & Theming:** Utilizes **CSS Variables** for a flexible, high-contrast color palette, and a user-controlled, accessible **Light/Dark Mode** implementation powered by native JS and CSS.
* **Layout:** Comprehensive **Media Queries** are used for fully responsive design, adapting seamlessly from mobile to desktop screens.
* **Tools & Assets:** **Git/GitHub** for version control; **Google Fonts** (`Lato`, `Source Sans Pro`) and **Font Awesome Icons** for iconography.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Local Setup

To run this portfolio project locally, no complex server environment or build tools are required, as it is built with Vanilla JavaScript and pure CSS. Simply follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    If you haven't already, clone the project repository to your local machine using the command below:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/KhodaniD/KHOMAI25088_PTO2502_GroupA_KhodaniMailula_CDV05]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and change to the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    cd Khodani-Mailula-Portfolio # (Or your actual folder name)
    ```

3.  **Open `index.html`:**

    Locate the `index.html` file in the root of the project directory. Double-click this file or drag it into your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to open it.

    *Note: Since the project uses only client-side code, it will run immediately without needing a local web server.*

## üñ• Working Usage Example

### Live Interaction Examples:

* **Theme Toggle:** Click the **moon/sun icon** in the navigation bar to immediately switch the entire portfolio between the light and dark themes. The change uses CSS variables to provide a seamless, high-contrast viewing experience.
* **Navigation:** Use the **sticky navigation links** (`Projects`, `Skills`, `Contact`) to instantly scroll to the respective section of the single-page application.
* **Project Links:** Click the **Live Demo** button on the Kanban project to see a deployed, fully interactive application separate from the portfolio.

### Responsive Behavior:

* **Desktop View:** The **Hero section** displays the content and avatar side-by-side. The **Projects** section shows a three-column card grid.
* **Mobile View (Resize):** When the screen width is reduced, the **Hero content** stacks vertically (with the avatar moving to the top), the **Project cards** collapse into a single-column layout, and the **navigation links** reorganize for easy tapping.

## üéì Education

The portfolio reflects current and foundational technical training:

* **Software Development Program** (CodeSpace Academy): Intensive full-stack training (Feb 2025 - Present).
* **NDIP Web & Application Development** (Tshwane University of Technology): Foundational degree completed 2007.
